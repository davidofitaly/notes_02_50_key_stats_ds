        "\n",
        "##### Key Measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mean (Average):**  \n",
        "   The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It is the most common measure of central tendency.  \n",
        "   $$ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$  \n",
        "   Where $x_i$ are the values, and $n$ is the number of data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Weighted Mean:**  \n",
        "   The weighted mean accounts for the importance (weight) of each data point. It is calculated by multiplying each value by its corresponding weight, summing them, and then dividing by the total weight.  \n",
        "   $$ \\text{Weighted Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i} $$  \n",
        "   Where $w_i$ represents the weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Trimmed Mean:**  \n",
        "   The trimmed mean is calculated by removing a specified percentage of the smallest and largest values before computing the mean. This reduces the influence of extreme values (outliers).  \n",
        "   $$ \\text{Trimmed Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n-k} x_i}{n-2k} $$  \n",
        "   Where $k$ is the number of values removed from each end.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Median:**  \n",
        "   The median is the middle value of a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it is the average of the two middle values.  \n",

        "\n",
        "5. **Weighted Median:**  \n",
        "   The weighted median is the median of a dataset where each data point has a weight. It is the value that divides the dataset such that the sum of weights on one side is as close as possible to the sum of weights on the other side.  \n",
        "   - There is no simple closed-form formula for the weighted median, but it can be found through sorting and cumulative weight calculations.  \n",

        "\n",
        "6. **Percentile:**  \n",
        "   A percentile is a value below which a certain percentage of data falls. For example, the 50th percentile is the median, the 25th percentile is the lower quartile, and the 75th percentile is the upper quartile.  \n",

        "\n",
        "8. **Outlier:**  \n",
        "   An outlier is an observation that lies far outside the range of most other data points. It can significantly affect the mean but has a minimal effect on the median.  \n",
        "   An outlier can be defined as any data point that lies more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) above the 75th percentile or below the 25th percentile.  \n",
